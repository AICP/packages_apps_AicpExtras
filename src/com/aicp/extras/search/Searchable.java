/**
 * This interface should be implemented by classes which want to provide additional
 * dynamic metadata to the indexer. Since our entrypoints are standardized around
 * the parts catalog, there is no need to enumerate XML resources here. Keywords
 * and non-indexable keys may be supplied by a class.
 *
 * If a class wants to use this functionality, it should contain a static field
 * named SEARCH_INDEX_DATA_PROVIDER which contains an instance of SearchIndexProvider.
 * This is similar to the mechanism used by the Settings app.
